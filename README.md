# FreezeSwitchV2
Rewritten in python, and works with the new 64 bit roblox client
made for roblox, this program freezes your roblox and unfreezes with the ~ key (you can change it)
and this is made for qwerty keyboards
# Changing Key
you can edit it in the code or suggest in the issues tab for me to add more keys

# Extra
for the seconds one, the max you can do is 9, anything above will just kick you from the game saying "no internet" (it says that cuz the game is frozen)
